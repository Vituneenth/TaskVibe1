## Product Requirements Prompt for Task management App


**Product name**: (Working title) TaskVibe

**One-sentence idea description**:  
A minimal yet colorful, gamified app that manages, prioritizes, and reminds users about personal and work tasks with smart patterns and gentle nudges, keeping them organized and motivated.

**User journey / flow**

1. **Signup & Onboarding**
   - User creates an account with email login; stays logged in for convenience.
   - App welcomes the user, asks for name/nickname, and connects email/calendar for sync only.

2. **Task Input & Management**
   - User starts by entering “immediate tasks.”
   - As those get completed, prompts for “less immediate” and then “can be delayed” tasks.
   - Tasks are grouped by urgency, each with its own color scheme (cold for low, warm for high).
   - Dashboard UI to view, add, delete, and review tasks.

3. **Reminders & Notifications**
   - Provides up to 3 reminders per day for *each* task category (immediate, less immediate, delayed) between 2PM and 10PM.
   - Reminders are in-app and calendar-based (never email).
   - Calendar sync only for the least urgent category.

4. **Theme Switching**
   - User can toggle between **light mode, dark mode, or system default** for interface appearance at any time.
   - All interface elements, including color-coded urgency buckets and dashboard, adapt seamlessly to the selected theme.

5. **Gamified Dashboard**
   - Clean, minimal, dashboard-focused layout.
   - Gamified elements (e.g., streaks, badges for consistent use or achieving priorities).

6. **Daily Review**
   - At 10PM, the app shows a summary of completed tasks.
   - User can review, celebrate, or reflect on progress.

7. **AI-Powered Suggestions (after 1 month)**
   - Once a user has been active for a month, the app analyzes patterns:
     - Recurring tasks/behaviors
     - Likely times tasks are completed
   - Provides smart suggestions:
     - Suggests commonly recurring tasks with a feature to add them 
     - Recommends the best time of day for reminders, personalized to the user’s habits
